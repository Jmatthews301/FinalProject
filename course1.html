      <h2>Cassel Hills Golf Course</h2>
      <p> Cassel Hills Golf course is located at the crossroads of I-75 and I-70 in Vandalia Ohio making it a very acessible Golf Course. It is a municipal golf course which means are all welcome! It is a par 71-course with 6,354 yards making it a championship length golf course. This course was designed by Jack Kidwell and Mike Hurdzan. I can describe this course as a lot of rolling hills, but it makes the game a lot more fun and different.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>The front nine of Cassel Hills is pretty flat, kind of ironic for the name! I think the fun starts when you get to the back 9 and it starts to get hilly! Its almost like you are playing 2 different courses. The course has 5 par 3's so the course plays a little longer than the yardage. The "standerd" number of par 3's on a golf course is 4, there are no requirements though as golf is a ever changing sport! The greens at Cassel Hill's are huge! Some of the biggest in Dayton, so you better start practicing your lag putting! Trying to score under 30 putts in a round is my end goal. Bigger greens means smarter club selection 150 yards in. You are 1 misstep from putting from 10 feet or 50 feet </p>

    <h2>Amenities/Pricing</h2>
    <p>Cassel Hills offers a driving range, a practice green, and a decent sized pro shop with fair pricing. The course also offers golf lessons for all ages. Cassel Hills of course has a dress policy as any other course would. Appropriate golf attire, including collard shirts and golf shoes. Only NON metal spikes allowed. Now the most important part, the green fees. The green fees always depend on the time of day and part of the week. Weekday rates usually start around $22 for 18 holes. If you want a cart add $10 to the price, but for $32 dollars you get to play 18 holes, for 4 hours, a really good deal. </p>
