      <h2>Welcome all Golfers</h2>
      <p>Do you shoot in the 90's+ and are looking for a great time in Dayton Ohio? Hello all! My name is Jeremy Matthews and I am guilty of loving golf! I am 26 years old born and raised in Dayton Ohio and have played on some incredible golf courses in Dayton Ohio. If you landed on my website you are either my teacher grading my final project or a golfer who is looking for some cool courses in the Dayton Ohio area! Below you find my pick of the top 5 golf courses in Dayton Ohio in no particular order. When I picked these golf courses my deciding factors were cost per round, pace of play, and how much fun I had with each course. Below you will find each golf course, I will provide a brief description of each course, highlighting their unique features and what sets them apart from the rest. I am no knows a golf professional or expert, I shot in the 90's to 100's but I have played way more than enough golf to appreciate what Dayton Ohio has to offer in terms of golf. If you would like to know more about me, head over to the contact page! Have a good day.</p>
